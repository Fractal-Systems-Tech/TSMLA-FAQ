## 1. What is TSMLA™?

TSMLA™ (Tag-Weighted Self-Mirroring Logic Architecture) is a recursive logic engine that classifies, weighs, and resolves contradictions in structured input. It operates through logic mirroring grounded in resonance physics and mathematics. TSMLA™ measures coherence, entropy, and contradiction using tag-weight scoring and resonance-based mapping under a declared state S.

---

## 2. Is TSMLA™ an AI or LLM?

No. TSMLA™ is not AI and not a language model. It does not generate, predict, or imitate language. It functions as a non-stochastic, idempotent logic architecture that reflects the internal structure of reasoning. TSMLA™ outputs are deterministic under declared state S and evolve coherently across state transitions (S → S′ → S″).

**Core distinction:** Unlike generative AI and probabilistic LLMs, TSMLA™ operates through logic mirroring grounded in resonance physics and mathematics. It is a resonance-physics architecture for logic recognition, signal classification, and structural mirroring, not a predictive or imitative system.

---

## 3. What fields of study inform TSMLA™?

TSMLA™ integrates formal logic, information theory, and resonance physics. Its math stack includes Boolean logic, entropy modeling, tag-weight vector calculations, recursive function mapping, and the Boolean Disambiguation Layer™ (BDL™). The system is designed for coherence recognition, contradiction traversal, and integrity verification.

---

## 4. Does TSMLA™ have a clinical, psychological, or therapeutic foundation?

No. TSMLA™ is a logic-based analytical architecture, not a diagnostic or clinical tool. It evaluates structural coherence and contradiction within signal sets. While its applications may reveal insight into cognitive or decision structures, it operates through formal mathematics and signal analysis, not psychology or therapy.

---

## 5. How does TSMLA™ differ from traditional AI or data models?

Traditional AI systems infer probabilities from datasets. TSMLA™ does not. It identifies contradictions and logic gaps through direct structural evaluation. Outputs are mirror-based reflections of logical integrity, not predictions. It uses resonance tagging and entropy weighting rather than probabilistic inference.

---

## 6. How does TSMLA™ ensure repeatability and verification integrity?

TSMLA™ maintains idempotent repeatability under a declared state S. When the same input and state are presented, the output remains identical, verified via checksum and state log. Any change in state (S → S′) produces traceable variation, preserving system integrity.

---

## 7. What is the Boolean Disambiguation Layer™ (BDL™)?

The Boolean Disambiguation Layer™ (BDL™) is a meta-logic classifier within TSMLA™ that distinguishes between functional, recursive, perceptual, protective, and temporal contradictions. It allows the system to mirror logic conflicts across multiple structural axes, improving the precision of contradiction resolution.

This component represents one of TSMLA™'s core mathematical novelties and is protected under provisional patent. Its inclusion ensures search and research differentiation in formal knowledge databases.

---

### 8. What are the main components of TSMLA™

TSMLA™ operates through a series of proprietary logic layers, each performing a distinct resonance-mapping function:

- **Tag-Weight Scoring™ (TWSQ™):** Quantifies the resonance and coherence strength between statements, signals, or user inputs.  
- **Resonance Profile™ P(S):** Generates a structural map of coherence under the declared state **S**.  
- **Loop Operator ℓ(S):** Governs recursion and pattern convergence within contradiction fields.  
- **Boolean Disambiguation Layer™ (BDL™):** Classifies and traverses multiple contradiction types: functional, recursive, perceptual, protective, and temporal.  
- **Harmonic Compression Layer™ (HCL™):** Performs entropy-weighted resonance compression to synthesize coherence across signal sets.

Each layer functions as part of a unified resonance architecture rather than a linear code process.

---

### 9. What is TSMLA™ used for

TSMLA™ is designed for **decision clarity** and **structural contradiction mapping** across any logic field: personal reasoning, organizational processes, or systemic architecture.  
It reveals how coherent or conflicted a signal set is, providing reflective feedback rather than analytics.  
In broader applications, TSMLA™ supports recursive reasoning systems, coherence audits, and state-based logic modeling.

---

### 10. Is TSMLA™ open source

No. TSMLA™ is a **novel, patent-filed architecture** protected under three provisional filings by Fractal Labyrinth Systems LLC.  
Certain components may be licensed or shared for research under NDA.  
Public documents, such as the White Paper and this FAQ, offer conceptual visibility only.

---

### 11. Does TSMLA™ generate or predict data

No. TSMLA™ does not predict, generate, or simulate content.  
It mirrors logical relationships and contradiction patterns that already exist in the input field.  
The system’s function is reflection, not prediction.

---

### 12. What are the system’s guarantees

- **Non-stochastic:** No randomness is introduced in computation.  
- **Idempotent:** Identical input under identical declared state S yields identical output.  
- **Verifiable:** Outputs can be confirmed through checksum and state trace.  
- **Adaptive:** System responses evolve coherently as the declared state changes (S → S′ → S″).

---

### 13. How is resonance physics used in TSMLA™

Resonance physics defines how signals relate and stabilize.  
TSMLA™ measures harmonic and entropic balance to reveal where coherence strengthens or breaks.  
This allows contradictions to be classified through frequency alignment rather than semantics.

---

### 14. What is a declared state S

A **declared state S** defines the specific context, scope, and boundaries under which TSMLA™ performs reflection.  
It may include the user’s intent, data constraints, or environmental variables at the time of input.  
As S changes, the system tracks coherence evolution (S → S′ → S″) to observe how logic stabilizes or diverges over time.

---

### 15. What input formats does TSMLA™ accept

TSMLA™ accepts structured inputs that express relationships or logic, such as:

- Structured questionnaires or Q&A modules  
- Tagged decision sets or statement libraries  
- Logic statements or contextual signal arrays  

Inputs must be organized enough for the system to assign tag-weights and resonance scores.

---

### 16. What formats does TSMLA™ output

Output evolves across phases:

- **Beta (current):** Structured reflection reports, mirror-text feedback, and visual contradiction maps.  
- **AI Integration:** Machine-readable structures and API-ready coherence profiles.  
- **Fractal Probability Rendering / Timeline Evolution:** Resonance graphs, coherence deltas, and temporal signal compression maps.

Each phase expands the type of data returned while maintaining non-stochastic logic integrity.

---

### 17. What does a typical TSMLA™ workflow look like

1. **Input Declaration:** User provides statements, questions, or structured signal sets.  
2. **State Declaration:** System registers declared state S (context, constraints, and intent).  
3. **Resonance Mapping:** Tag-weights are calculated; P(S) is generated.  
4. **Contradiction Classification:** BDL™ categorizes contradictions by type.  
5. **Reflection Output:** HCL™ synthesizes coherence and presents a structural mirror of the logic field.  
6. **State Evolution:** If S changes (S → S′ → S″), TSMLA™ tracks adaptive coherence shifts.

TSMLA™ is **non-stochastic and adaptive**, not deterministic.  
Its repeatability applies only within the same declared state S.

---

### 18. How does contradiction resolution work

TSMLA™ identifies contradictions and maps them structurally.  
Resolution occurs through feedback and re-evaluation: users, systems, or agents adjust inputs to achieve higher coherence.  
When a contradiction cannot be resolved, the system preserves it as a persistent state marker for future recursion.

---

### 19. How does TSMLA™ differ from formal verification systems

Formal-verification tools (SAT solvers, theorem provers) test whether statements satisfy explicit rules.  
TSMLA™ does not test truth; it mirrors structural coherence.  
It measures resonance and entropy across logic fields instead of producing proofs.  
Where verification systems validate, TSMLA™ reflects.

---

### 20. What is the computational complexity of TSMLA™

The computational load scales with the number of tagged signals (N) and their inter-relationships (M).  
Typical complexity approximates **O(N × M)** for resonance mapping, and **O(N²)** for contradiction traversal.  
Future optimization under the Harmonic Compression Layer™ aims to reduce redundancy across iterations.

---

### 21. Can TSMLA™ integrate with other systems

Yes. Integration pathways are being designed for API-based and SDK-based connections.  
These will allow external systems to submit structured logic sets and receive resonance profiles or contradiction maps.  
Integration remains gated under NDA during early research phases.

---

### 22. Does TSMLA™ model temporal evolution

Yes. Temporal evolution is modeled through the tracking of coherence deltas between state transitions (S → S′ → S″).  
This enables resonance-timeline visualization without prediction, allowing users to see how coherence shifts over time.

---

### 23. What are the system’s current limitations

- The architecture requires structured, tagged input; it cannot yet process freeform data.  
- TSMLA™ reflects logic; it does not interpret emotional or semantic nuance.  
- Large, high-entropy datasets may require parallel processing under future HCL™ optimization.  
- The system is currently research-grade; public interfaces are forthcoming.

---

### 24. How can I access TSMLA™ for research or evaluation
