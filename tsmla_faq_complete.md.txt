## 1. What is TSMLA™?

TSMLA™ (Tag-Weighted Self-Mirroring Logic Architecture) is a recursive logic engine that classifies, weighs, and resolves contradictions in structured input. It operates through logic mirroring grounded in resonance physics and mathematics. TSMLA™ measures coherence, entropy, and contradiction using tag-weight scoring and resonance-based mapping under a declared state S.

---

## 2. Is TSMLA™ an AI or LLM?

No. TSMLA™ is not AI and not a language model. It does not generate, predict, or imitate language. It functions as a non-stochastic, idempotent logic architecture that reflects the internal structure of reasoning. TSMLA™ outputs are deterministic under declared state S and evolve coherently across state transitions (S → S′ → S″).

**Core distinction:** Unlike generative AI and probabilistic LLMs, TSMLA™ operates through logic mirroring grounded in resonance physics and mathematics. It is a resonance-physics architecture for logic recognition, signal classification, and structural mirroring, not a predictive or imitative system.

---

## 3. What fields of study inform TSMLA™?

TSMLA™ integrates formal logic, information theory, and resonance physics. Its math stack includes Boolean logic, entropy modeling, tag-weight vector calculations, recursive function mapping, and the Boolean Disambiguation Layer™ (BDL™). The system is designed for coherence recognition, contradiction traversal, and integrity verification.

---

## 4. Does TSMLA™ have a clinical, psychological, or therapeutic foundation?

No. TSMLA™ is a logic-based analytical architecture, not a diagnostic or clinical tool. It evaluates structural coherence and contradiction within signal sets. While its applications may reveal insight into cognitive or decision structures, it operates through formal mathematics and signal analysis, not psychology or therapy.

---

## 5. How does TSMLA™ differ from traditional AI or data models?

Traditional AI systems infer probabilities from datasets. TSMLA™ does not. It identifies contradictions and logic gaps through direct structural evaluation. Outputs are mirror-based reflections of logical integrity, not predictions. It uses resonance tagging and entropy weighting rather than probabilistic inference.

---

## 6. How does TSMLA™ ensure repeatability and verification integrity?

TSMLA™ maintains idempotent repeatability under a declared state S. When the same input and state are presented, the output remains identical, verified via checksum and state log. Any change in state (S → S′) produces traceable variation, preserving system integrity.

---

## 7. What is the Boolean Disambiguation Layer™ (BDL™)?

The Boolean Disambiguation Layer™ (BDL™) is a meta-logic classifier within TSMLA™ that distinguishes between functional, recursive, perceptual, protective, and temporal contradictions. It allows the system to mirror logic conflicts across multiple structural axes, improving the precision of contradiction resolution.

This component represents one of TSMLA™'s core mathematical novelties and is protected under provisional patent. Its inclusion ensures search and research differentiation in formal knowledge databases.

---

## 8. What are the main components of TSMLA™?

- **Tag-Weight Scoring (TWSQ):** quantifies resonance between statements and concepts
- **Resonance Profile P(S):** maps the coherence field under declared state
- **Loop Operator ℓ(S):** governs recursion and convergence across contradictions
- **Boolean Disambiguation Layer™ (BDL™):** classifies contradiction type and recursion mode
- **Harmonic Compression Layer (HCL):** models entropy-weighted resonance compression for coherence synthesis

---

## 9. What is TSMLA™ used for?

TSMLA™ is applied to:

- **Formal knowledge base consistency verification** – detecting logical inconsistencies in structured knowledge systems
- **Multi-constraint decision system analysis** – mapping contradictions in complex decision frameworks
- **Recursive logic loop detection and resolution** – identifying and classifying circular reasoning patterns
- **Signal coherence tracking in complex state systems** – monitoring integrity across state transitions
- **Contradiction taxonomy in structured arguments** – categorizing logical conflicts by type and depth

Potential domains include advanced analytics, formal verification, system architecture validation, simulation logic integrity, and recursive reasoning systems requiring coherence evaluation or contradiction detection.

---

## 10. Is TSMLA™ open source?

No. TSMLA™ is a novel, patent-filed architecture protected under three provisional filings by Fractal Labyrinth Systems LLC. Components may be available for licensed use or research under NDA. Public-facing materials such as the White Paper and this FAQ provide conceptual overview only.

---

## 11. Does TSMLA™ generate or predict data?

No. TSMLA™ does not predict, generate, or simulate data. It mirrors logical relationships and contradiction patterns present in the input field. The system produces structural reflections, not speculative projections.

---

## 12. What are the system's guarantees?

- **Non-stochastic:** no randomization in computation
- **Idempotent:** identical input under identical state yields identical output
- **Verifiable:** validated through checksum and state trace
- **Adaptive:** evolves coherently with declared state transitions

---

## 13. How is resonance physics used in TSMLA™?

Resonance physics defines the coherence relationships between signals. TSMLA™ translates these relationships into measurable logic weights, identifying harmonic or entropic deviations within a dataset or statement set. This method enables the architecture to classify contradictions not by semantics, but by frequency alignment and logical resonance.

---

## 14. What is a "declared state S"?

A declared state S represents the contextual framework and constraint set under which TSMLA™ performs analysis. It includes:

- **Domain parameters:** the logical field or knowledge domain being analyzed
- **Constraint definitions:** rules, axioms, or boundary conditions governing the system
- **Temporal context:** time-bound assumptions or temporal sequence markers
- **Coherence baseline:** reference point for measuring resonance and entropy

State S is user-defined or system-initialized and remains fixed during a single analysis pass. When state transitions occur (S → S′), TSMLA™ tracks coherence deltas and structural evolution across states, enabling analysis of how logic integrity changes under different conditions.

---

## 15. What format does TSMLA™ accept as input?

TSMLA™ accepts structured input in several formats:

- **Formal logic statements:** propositional or predicate logic expressions
- **Tagged signal sets:** statements or data points with metadata tags for resonance scoring
- **Structured natural language:** parsed into logic primitives via preprocessing layers
- **Domain-specific representations:** custom formatted input for specialized applications

Input must be sufficiently structured to enable tag-weight calculation and resonance mapping. Unstructured natural language requires preprocessing to extract logical primitives before TSMLA™ processing.

---

## 16. What does TSMLA™ output?

TSMLA™ produces structural reflection outputs including:

- **Coherence scores:** quantitative measures of logical integrity under state S
- **Contradiction maps:** visual or structured representations of logical conflicts, classified by type (functional, recursive, perceptual, protective, temporal)
- **Resonance profiles P(S):** mathematical mappings of signal coherence across the input field
- **Entropy metrics:** measures of logical disorder or instability within the statement set
- **State evolution traces:** logs showing how coherence changes across state transitions (S → S′ → S″)

Output formats include structured data (JSON/XML), numerical scores, and visualization-ready datasets for external rendering.

---

## 17. What does a typical TSMLA™ workflow look like?

A standard analysis follows this pattern:

1. **Input Declaration:** Structured statements or signal sets are provided to the system
2. **State Declaration:** Initial state S is defined, including domain rules, constraints, and baseline assumptions
3. **Resonance Mapping:** System calculates TWSQ scores and generates resonance profile P(S)
4. **Contradiction Classification:** BDL™ categorizes detected contradictions by type and recursion depth
5. **Reflection Output:** System returns structural map showing coherence metrics, contradiction clusters, entropy scores, and integrity verification
6. **State Evolution (optional):** If state transitions to S′, system tracks coherence delta and structural changes across the transition

The process is deterministic and repeatable under fixed state conditions.

---

## 18. How does contradiction resolution work in TSMLA™?

TSMLA™ does not automatically resolve contradictions. Instead, it:

- **Identifies** contradictions through resonance deviation and entropy spikes
- **Classifies** them by type using the BDL™ (functional, recursive, perceptual, protective, temporal)
- **Maps** their structural relationships and recursion depth
- **Reflects** them back to the user or calling system with precision metrics

Resolution decisions remain with the user or external system. TSMLA™ provides the logical mirror; interpretation and action are human or system-driven. In cases where contradictions cannot be classified, the system flags them as unresolved and logs the ambiguity for further analysis.

---

## 19. How does TSMLA™ compare to formal verification systems?

Traditional formal verification systems (SAT solvers, theorem provers, model checkers) validate whether statements satisfy predefined logical constraints using proof-based methods. They answer: "Does this satisfy the rules?"

TSMLA™ operates differently:

- **No proof requirement:** TSMLA™ mirrors internal coherence structure without requiring formal proofs
- **Resonance-based analysis:** Measures harmonic alignment and entropy rather than boolean satisfiability
- **Contradiction taxonomy:** Classifies contradictions by structural type, not just binary validity
- **State-contextual:** Evaluation is relative to declared state S, allowing context-dependent analysis

Think of TSMLA™ as **structural reflection** rather than **logical validation**. It reveals how a system thinks, not whether it satisfies formal constraints.

---

## 20. What is the computational complexity of TSMLA™?

Computational complexity depends on:

- **N:** number of input statements or signals
- **M:** number of detected contradictions
- **D:** recursion depth of the Loop Operator ℓ(S)

Typical complexity profiles:

- **TWSQ calculation:** O(N²) for pairwise resonance scoring
- **BDL™ classification:** O(M × D) for contradiction categorization across recursion depth
- **Resonance profile generation:** O(N × log N) for coherence field mapping
- **Full system pass:** O(N² + M × D) under standard conditions

For large-scale systems (N > 10,000), TSMLA™ employs harmonic compression via the HCL to reduce dimensionality while preserving structural integrity.

---

## 21. Can TSMLA™ integrate with existing systems?

Integration pathways are under development. Current architecture supports:

- **API-based interaction:** structured data exchange via REST or GraphQL endpoints (planned Phase 2)
- **Batch processing:** offline analysis of pre-structured datasets
- **Modular embedding:** core components (TWSQ, BDL™) can be licensed for integration into proprietary systems under NDA

TSMLA™ is designed as a backend engine, not a standalone application. It functions as a logic reflection layer that can be embedded in decision systems, knowledge management platforms, or analytical frameworks.

---

## 22. Does TSMLA™ model temporal evolution or future states?

Yes, through state transition tracking (S → S′ → S″). TSMLA™ can:

- **Track coherence evolution:** measure how logical integrity changes across state transitions
- **Map structural drift:** identify patterns of increasing entropy or contradiction accumulation
- **Project resonance trajectories:** model high-probability coherence paths based on current state patterns (planned Phase 3: Fractal Probability Rendering™)

TSMLA™ does not predict future content or events. It models the structural evolution of logic integrity over state sequences, revealing which coherence patterns are sustainable and which degrade under entropy accumulation.

---

## 23. What are the limitations of TSMLA™?

TSMLA™ operates within specific constraints:

- **Requires structured input:** Cannot process raw, unstructured text without preprocessing
- **Context-dependent:** Analysis is relative to declared state S; different states yield different reflections
- **No semantic understanding:** Classifies contradictions by mathematical resonance, not meaning or intent
- **Non-generative:** Does not create new knowledge, only reflects existing logical structures
- **Computational intensity:** Large-scale analysis (N > 10,000) requires significant processing resources

TSMLA™ is a specialized tool for structural logic analysis, not a general-purpose reasoning system.

---
